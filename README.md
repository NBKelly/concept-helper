# concept-helper
A simple java script set meant to ease the difficulty and repetitive aspects of making proof of concept models. 

This is primarily for my own use. It's a little script I've slowly compiled and modified while I practice programming contest problems. For an example of a project where it has been used, see https://github.com/NBKelly/QuickLinks.

### Features
* Handles all input from the inputstream (primarily meant for programming contest problems)
* Handles this input is ints, lines, and bigints
* error output can be enabled/disabled at runtime
* exceptions can be disabled/enabled at runtime
* timer output can be enabled/disabled at runtime
* information can be displayed on output consumed/not consumed
* Some simple arithmetic operations have been inmplemnted (GCD (including collections), LCM (including collections))
* support for simple timesplits without any extra coding required
